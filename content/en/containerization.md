Containerization is the packaging of software code with just the operating system (OS) libraries and dependencies required to run the code to create a single lightweight executableâ€”called a container, that runs consistently on any infrastructure. More portable and resource-efficient than virtual machines (VMs). They have become the de facto compute units of modern cloud-native applications.
## Problem it addresses 

Before [containers](/container/) became prevalent, organizations relied on [virtual machines](/virtual-machine/) (VMs) to 
orchestrate multiple applications on a single [bare-metal machine](/bare-metal-machine/). 
VMs are significantly larger than containers and require a hypervisor to run. 
Due to the storage, backup, and transfer of these larger VM templates, creating the VM templates is also slow. 
Additionally, VMs can suffer from configuration drift which violates the principle of [immutability](/immutable-infrastructure/).

## How it helps

Container images are lightweight (unlike traditional VMs) and 
the containerization process requires a file with a list of dependencies. 
This file can be version controlled and the build process automated, 
allowing an organization to focus on other priorities 
while the automated processes take care of the build. 
A container image is stored by a unique identifier 
that is tied to its exact content and configuration. 
As containers are scheduled and rescheduled, 
they are always reset to their initial state which eliminates configuration drift.
